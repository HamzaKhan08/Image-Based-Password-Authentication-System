# Image-Based-Password-Authentication-System

We have developed a website which provides the functionality of  Image based password authentication system, which uses images instead of regular passwords. According to human psychology, images are easier to remember than text.
Moreover, people tend to make very weak and popular passwords which are prone to social engineering attacks, hence image passwords can solve this problem.

Furthermore, if a user spends more than 30 seconds for login, the session will be expired- use of Jason Web Tokens (JWT), and upon entering incorrect password or in case a user forgets his/her password an email will be sent through SMTP (with the help of email.js library).
